    Connecting a Memory Card to Arduino:
    ------------------------------------
    Looking at the Memory Card:
    _________________
    |_ _|_ _ _|_ _ _|
     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
     
     1 DATA - Pin 12 on Arduino
     2 CMND - Pin 11 on Arduino
     3 7.6V - 5V Pin on Arduino
     4 GND - GND Pin on Arduino
     5 3.6V - 5V Pin on Arduino
     6 ATT - Pin 10 on Arduino
     7 CLK - Pin 13 on Arduino
     8 ACK - Pin 2 on Arduino
     
     If your card still isn't readable and it's a 3rd party card,
     you will need to supply it with 7.6 V extrenal power supply.
     
     Interfacing a MemCARDuino:
     ---------------------------
     Communication is done at 38400 bps.
     To check if the MemCARDuino is connected to the selected COM port send a GETID command.
     Device should respond with IDENTIFIER.
     Optionally you can send a GETVER to get the version of the firmware.
     
     To Read a 128byte frame send a MCR command with MSB byte and LSB byte of the frame you want to read.
     MemCARDduino will respond with 128 byte frame data, [MSB xor LSB xor Data] and Memory Card status byte.
     
     To Write a frame send a MCW command with MSB byte and LSB byte, 128 byte data and [MSB xor LSB xor Data].
     MemCARDduino will respond with Memory Card status byte.
     
     Checking if the Memory Card is inserted:
     -----------------------------------------
     Read a frame of the card and verify the returned status byte.
     If it's 0x47 then card is connected. If it's 0xFF card is not connected.
